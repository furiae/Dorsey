  <p>Planning for 2013? Our popular and highly successful workshop series is back! <br />
    <br />
    Back by popular demand and updated with new tools, methodologies and strategies, The Dorsey Group will offer four off-site, two day training workshops in 2013. Designed for clients who want to refresh existing or train new employees or non-clients who want to gain essential knowledge without fully committing to a consulting arrangement, each workshop is an intensive study that will equip you with powerful knowledge that you can act on immediately. <br />
    <br />
    Beginning in February with &ldquo;Optimizing Performance, Empowering People&rdquo;, the workshops promise to provide explicit insights into employee engagement and the building of high performance work teams. <br />
    <br />
    Additional workshops will be held in May, August and October, with updated workshop topics to be announced in our January 2013 newsletter and our website. <br />
    <br />
  To request information (date, location and cost) for our February Workshop contact us at info@thedorseygroup.org or call 954-384-8774.</p>
