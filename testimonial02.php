  <h2>From Good to Great</h2>
  <p>&quot;Our company was operating very successfully prior to working with the Dorsey Group.  However, after bringing in Tim and his Partners in Performance processes into Operations, we were able to establish more meaningful metrics and team accountability for achieving &#151; and exceeding &#151; our production goals.</p>
  <p>After meeting and exceeding production goals, we were able to better align support efforts from other departments, which fostered the creation of our ongoing Continual Improvement culture.  Our C.I. initiative now focuses multi-disciplinary teams on projects designed to achieve improved production throughput and aggressive financial goals.&quot;</p>

  <p><span class="bigquoteStart"><img src="img/quoteStart.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></span>I have used the Dorsey Group to launch teams at 3 different companies across 3 different industries —
    every one of them has been a major success. Their methodology zeros in on all areas that short circuit
    results and every step in the training process is designed to convert effort to the bottom line. We had a
    41% improvement in Gross Margins.<span class="bigquoteEnd"><img src="img/quoteEnd.png" alt="" width="16" height="16"/></span></p>
