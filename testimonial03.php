  <h2>High Performance Team Implementation</h2>
  <p>&quot;We invested considerable time and efforts in finding the right partner to accompany us on our teaming journey. We found that The Dorsey Group distinguished itself by offering a structured, comprehensive &amp; systemic approach to teaming.  After just a few weeks into the initiative, the teams had already made substantial progress in solving the challenges we had, notably for shift passdown and using 5S tools to eliminate wasted time. We knew we were on the right track. The Dorsey Group continues to deliver measured results.&quot;</p>

  <p><span class="bigquoteStart"><img src="img/quoteStart.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></span>I have used the Dorsey Group to launch teams at 3 different companies across 3 different industries —
    every one of them has been a major success. Their methodology zeros in on all areas that short circuit
    results and every step in the training process is designed to convert effort to the bottom line. We had a
    41% improvement in Gross Margins.<span class="bigquoteEnd"><img src="img/quoteEnd.png" alt="" width="16" height="16"/></span></p>

  <p><span class="bigquoteStart"><img src="img/quoteStart.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></span>Our company was operating very successfully prior to working with the Dorsey Group. However, after bringing in Tim and his Partners in Performance processes, we were able to establish more meaningful metrics and team accountability for achieving and exceeding our production goals.<span class="bigquoteEnd"><img src="img/quoteEnd.png" alt="" width="16" height="16"/></span></p>
