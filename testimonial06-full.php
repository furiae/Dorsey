  <h2>Impressive Results</h2>
  <p>"Initially, we chose The Dorsey Group because of their track record for successfully implementing results oriented performance improvement initiatives for a wide range of prominent companies both domestic and international.  Your unique and targeted performance driven consulting services were exactly what we needed. We were impressed with your commitment to be physically present on a weekly basis at the startup and your flexibility in adapting your methodology to our specific circumstances. We clearly have seen an increase in our employee’s performance both in “ownership” and accountability, as well as a more structured approach to communication, problem solving and enhanced personal relations in team building. With The Dorsey Group, our performance has improved dramatically and impressive quantitative results have been realized."</p>
